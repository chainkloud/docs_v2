# Mix Governance

Governance is currently split among the following actors:

**1) Network Validators.** Mix Network validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [Mix improvement proposals](https://docs.fuse.io/general/fips) (FIPs). Regardless of their share of the overall network stake, every validator has one vote, but this will likely change soon.

**2) Mix Foundation and the project team.** Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the Mix treasury that primarily consists of the undistributed genesis MIX supply (see the subsection "[MIX Supply and Current Distribution](https://docs.fuse.io/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)") are currently managed mainly by a foundation.

For Mix, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company Mix Network Limited. Mix Foundation employs the Mix project team, whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://fuse.io/about).

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators and other protocol changes that do not require validator votes and maintain the full node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on Mix.

It also boosts the network's adoption by improving the Mix tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects, and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.

Since Mix is a decentralized public blockchain platform, no permission from the project team is required for anyone who wishes to integrate with or develop on top of Mix, including the network and node software development.
