# Add Mix to MetaMask and Other Wallets

[Click here](https://news.fuse.io/how-to-add-fuse-network-to-metamask/) for a complete step-by-step guide to adding Mix to MetaMask. Alternatively, manually add the information below to your MetaMask wallet.

The standard way for users to connect to the Mix Network blockchain is with a blockchain wallet like Metamask:

* Network name: **Mix Network**
* ChanId: **122**
* Gas price: **10 gwei**
* RPC: [https://mainnet-rpc.miexs.com/](https://mainnet-rpc.miexs.com/), or any other from the [list](../rpc.md)
* Native token: **MIX**
* Explorer: [https://miexs.com/](https://miexs.com/)

The process is the same if another wallet requires adding Mix Network manually, although sometimes less information may be required.

Some wallets also support adding the Mix Network via tools like [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/).
