# Overview

Welcome to the Mix developer documentation! Here you can find all the information you need to build applications on the Mix network.

Mix is a public layer-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain that focuses on transforming the global payment system. Our platform provides an open environment for developers to create new applications, as well as integrating existing ones with web3 technologies.

### Differences between Mix and Ethereum <a href="#differences-between-gnosis-and-ethereum" id="differences-between-gnosis-and-ethereum"></a>

As an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based chain, Mix Chain's development is essentially the same as that of Ethereum and other EVM chains. For more information, see below the Mix protocol specifications.

### Why Mix

* We're the best choice for your organization with our instant 5-second processing times and minimal transaction fees (up to $.01).&#x20;
* Smart contracts, decentralized applications, and toolset interoperability with Ethereum and similar EVM chains.&#x20;
* BlockScout-based full-featured explorer.&#x20;
* Comprehensive community support.&#x20;
* The ecosystem is expanding to accommodate many forms of secure peer-to-peer and microtransactions, conference and community currencies, DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, games, and more.

### Getting Started

To get started, we recommend checking out our developer resources section. Here you will find the tools and documentation you need to start building on Mix.

Our [Mix SDK](fuse-sdk/) provides developers with a set of tools to enable web3 integrations into their applications. With account abstraction, smart contract wallets, fee abstraction, and more, our SDK enables developers to create seamless web3 user experiences.

### Documentation

Our documentation covers a range of topics, from setting up a local development environment to deploying a smart contract on the Mix network. Our API documentation provides a reference for all the functions and endpoints available on the Mix network.

### Community Support

Join our developer community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZxN8Zbrk) or [Telegram](https://t.me/chainkloud/163566) to get help from other developers and to stay up to date with the latest news and updates from the Mix team. Our community is a great place to ask questions, share knowledge, and collaborate with other developers.
